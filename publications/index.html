      <p>The National Society of Black Engineersâ€™ Technical OutReach Community Help (TORCH) program aims to promote the value of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) education at all levels by increasing exposure, enthusiasm, skills, and participation within the Black community. This initiative is accomplished through unique formal and informal experiences led by Black college student-leaders within the student-run national organization at local, regional and national scales. The program components include formal classroom-style training, informal activities, grassroots outreach, direct technical service and, for organizational reasons, traditional community service activities as well. The program was developed and is managed centrally, but the majority of program implementation is facilitated by host organizationâ€™s chapters, operating independently. The success of the program is driven by the student chapters and the community partnerships they create in the implementation of its activities. Through their creativity and leadership the partnerships created have ranged from technology to education. Furthermore, frequent leadership changes annually at all levels pose an additional threat to sustaining these essential relationships. We present preliminary analysis of the formation and maintenance of community partnerships for each of the program components and their impact on the efforts. We take as examples several programs that have been active over varying lengths of time and examine the interactions between the types of partnerships, attendance at various program components and student volunteer participation. \textcopyright American Society of Engeneering Education, 2013.</p>

      <p>The National Society of Black Engineers Technical Outreach Community Help (NSBE TORCH) Program aims to provide exposure, stimulate enthusiasm and promote the value of science, technology, engineering and math in Black communities by providing introductory training with the ultimate goal of increasing participation in these fields at all levels. The program originated in 2002, and over the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 leadership years the program was revised and refined to have clear objectives and subcomponents consisting of both informal and formal educational components. The program is organized at a national level and administered locally in a grassroots fashion. Sample program models and resources are provided to local student leadership for selective implementation with the support of national and regional student leaders. In this paper we examine the program model and the ability to measure impact through the grassroots student run organization of the program. We present preliminary data from pilot programs and evaluations from volunteers and local level leaders of both the program model and the impact of the program. Data collected from participants includes demographics data, efficacy and learning assessments, and evaluations of the programs? content. This data is collected through survey templates provided to local student leaders, tabulated locally, and returned to the National leadership. Through the pilot studies the data collection and research methods are verified for their effectiveness in this unique program model. This paper will present the program assessment for internal development as well as address research questions about engineering students involved in STEM mentoring activities. Finally we present recommendations for developing the program further and a plan for a comprehensive study of the impact of the program. In short term for the students benefitting and longer term of the mentors and volunteers involved. A research plan and toolkit that accommodates for this and allows for sample size increases toward significance are derived from the pilot results. \textcopyright 2011 American Society for Engineering Education.</p>

      <p>Providing exposure, stimulating enthusiasm, training, promoting the value of engineering, and mentoring minority K-12 students, as a means to increasing STEM participation is the primary goal of the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) Technical Outreach Community Help (TORCH) program. The program has taken advantage of its unique opportunity to increase the number of minority students that are exposed to engineering through an outreach and mentorship model using the face of NSBEâ€™s collegiate and alumni members. Utilization of formal and informal environments, with African American mentors in engineering provides a unique experience for participants to discover the field and explore the disciplines. The combination of mentors who share ethnic background, similar experiences, and the actual content of the program help to diminish the barrier between minority K-12 students and engineering. This paper will cover the design, content, and assessment of the TORCH program, as well as discuss the programâ€™s progress and future. \textcopyright American Society for Engineering Education, 2010.</p>
